Plumb

Plumb is a tool for composing web layouts that figures out HTML and CSS from shapes you draw, using a vertical grid system. See example.html for demo.

Plumb is targeting an imaginary version of CSS in which dimensions can be specified by expressions like "50% - 200px". It doesn't currently have a way of generating usable layouts.
