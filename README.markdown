Plumb
=====

Plumb is a tool for composing web layouts that figures out HTML and CSS from shapes you draw, using a vertical grid system. See example.html for a demo.

------

Plumb is targeting an imaginary version of CSS in which dimensions can be specified by expressions like "50% - 200px". It will generate some example HTML from anything you draw, but the CSS won't work if you make some of the shapes stretchy. Generating "stacks and flows" for Shoes might be an option, though!
