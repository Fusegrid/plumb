Plumb
=====

Plumb is a tool for composing web layouts that figures out HTML and CSS from shapes you draw, using a vertical grid system.

As a result of some re-writing, Plumb's layout generation is in a half-finished state, but the interface is functional (have a look at the example to see what's what). The aim is to support arbitrary "stretchy" layouts -- without the use of table tags, of course. There are a few experiments with this in the "stretchiness" dir, which involve wrapping and other tricks.
